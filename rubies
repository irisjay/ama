fetch and update packages on demand.
    keep track of version? no. im simple.
    
    just keep track of where to get me. no additional transforms.
    
    how about recursive dependencies?
        in npm, the linking is done in code, dynamically.
        here its quite static.
        will recursive structures even be supported?
        how are recursive stuff useful anyway?
        you can you them to import a big thing monolithically, encapsulating the details.
        but you will pollute the namespace.
        so its a sin, basically.
        
        lets just support simple files. as of now.
